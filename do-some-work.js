/* 
  * Port 7000: Faux session cache (Redis or some such thing)
  * Port 7001: Faux database (MongoDB, LevelDB, Postgres, etc)

As in the previous lesson, use the q-io module to create promises
as wrappers for HTTP responses.  Hint: You will probably need more
than one promiseâ€¦

  * Send an HTTP GET request to the session cache on port 7000.  
    A string will be returned to you representing a user ID.
  * Grab that ID from the session response and send an HTTP GET request to your database on port 7001 
    to the url `localhost:7001/<id>`.
  * If successfully done, your database will return a user object.
    *`console.log` that user object

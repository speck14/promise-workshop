Exercises from "Promise-it-won't-hurt" workshop
Source: https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt

##Exercise notes:
- The workshop was written using deprecated os.tmpDir, causing every exercise after the first to break. [How to fix](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt/issues/159)
- Exercise #12 (Fetch JSON) doesn't provide the URL to which you're sending a request. Request should be sent to localhost:1337. [See issue](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt/issues/146)
